Private collection of resources to learn facial recognition, machine learning and all the buzzwords...

Tools that could help
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (For image and video manipulation)
* [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/index.html) (For optimization)
* Numpy (Linear Algebra)

# Tutorials for facial recognition

1. [Machine Learning is fun!: Modern Face recognition with deep learning](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78)\\This link is really interesting. 

# General neural network resources

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)

2. [CVXPY Examples](http://www.cvxpy.org/examples/index.html)

# Optimization courses
1. [Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLq1hEq3UY&list=PL3940DD956CDF0622)\\
This course covers how to use CVX package and various other algorithms etc.

# Other notes
So there is code and stuff provided (which I struggle to follow sometimes), but I would like to get to a point when I could write my own code. As soon as I have some working code I'll send it through. So far I can just implement the structure of the neural net. \\
From there it'll just be reading in the images using OpenCV, Optimizing some cost function (or another algroithm) and then training the network.
